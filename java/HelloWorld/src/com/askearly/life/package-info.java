 * Welcome to life. This is simply a test of javadocs...nothing important is
 * going on in these classes. You can ignore all of this if you wish...I mean I
 * sure would. Think of it is a testbed, it's not a proof of concept, as a proof
 * of concept was created long before javadoc became an integrated piece of the
 * Java programming language.
